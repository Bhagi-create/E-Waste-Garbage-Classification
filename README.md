# E-Waste-Garbage-Classification


WEEK 1 : EDA


•	TensorFlow and Keras: These are the core tools for building and training your image classification model. Think of them as the engine and framework for your AI.
•	EfficientNetV2B0: This is a pre-built, powerful model that's already good at recognizing images. Using it saves you a lot of time and effort compared to building a model from scratch.
•	NumPy and Pandas: These are for handling and organizing your data (like image information and labels) before and after you work with the AI model.
•	Matplotlib and Seaborn: These help you visualize your data and the results of your model, like showing how many images you have in each category or how well your model is performing.
•	Scikit-learn metrics: These give you ways to measure how good your model is at classifying images.
•	Gradio: This helps you create a simple web interface to test out your trained model with your own images.
•	PIL (Pillow): This is for opening and working with the image files themselves.
•	OS: This helps you navigate and interact with the folders and files on your computer where your images are stored.ss
